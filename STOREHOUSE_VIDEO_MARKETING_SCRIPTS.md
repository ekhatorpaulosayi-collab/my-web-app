**Duration:** 60 seconds | **Platform:** Instagram/Facebook | **Priority:** LOW (Phase 2)

### HOOK (Optimized for Conversion):
*"3am. Customer asks: 'Is size 44 available?' You're sleeping. Who answers? Your AI assistant."*

### VISUAL FLOW:

**Scene 1** (0-10 seconds)
- **Visual:** Dark room, person sleeping peacefully
- **Time stamp:** 3:14 AM
- **Phone vibrates with message notification**
- **Message:** "Hello, do you have Nike Air Max in size 44?"
- **Voiceover:** "3am. Customer browsing your online store. Question: Do you have their size?"

**Scene 2** (10-22 seconds)
- **Visual:** Split comparison - What usually happens
- **Without AI:** Message sits unread → Customer waits → Customer buys from 24/7 competitor
- **Text Overlay:** "You lose sale while sleeping"
- **Voiceover:** "Normal stores? Message waits till morning. Customer already bought elsewhere. Sale lost."

**Scene 3** (22-35 seconds)
- **Visual:** Storehouse chat widget activating on online store
- **Chat flow:**
  - Customer: "Is size 44 available?"
  - AI: "Hi! Yes, Nike Air Max size 44 is in stock (3 units left). Price: ₦25,000. Would you like to place an order?"
  - Customer: "What's the delivery time to Lekki?"
  - AI: "Delivery to Lekki: 1-2 business days. Cost: ₦2,500. We accept bank transfer or card payment."
- **Text Overlay:** "AI answers instantly. 24/7."
- **Voiceover:** "Storehouse AI assistant? Answers instantly. Stock info. Prices. Delivery. Payment. All accurate."

**Scene 4** (35-47 seconds)
- **Visual:** Morning - Shop owner wakes up
- **Phone notification:** "You have 3 new orders!"
- **Orders placed:** 3:15am | 5:42am | 6:58am
- **Total:** ₦67,500
- **Text Overlay:** "Wake up to sales you didn't make"
- **Voiceover:** "You wake up. Three orders. ₦67,500. You didn't lift a finger."

**Scene 5** (47-55 seconds)
- **Visual:** What the AI can handle (checklist)
- **Capabilities:**
  ✅ Product availability
  ✅ Price inquiries
  ✅ Delivery information
  ✅ Payment methods
  ✅ Product recommendations
  ✅ Order tracking
- **Text Overlay:** "Handles 90% of customer questions"
- **Voiceover:** "Stock questions. Prices. Delivery. Payment. The AI handles everything. You only step in for special requests."

**Scene 6** (55-60 seconds)
- **Visual:** Store owner relaxing while sales counter increases
- **Text Overlay:** "Your business never sleeps. You can."
- **CTA:** "FREE AI assistant included | storehouse.com.ng"

### WHY IT WORKS:
- Hook uses specific scenario (3am = relatable insomnia browsing)
- Shows passive income (make money while sleeping)
- Addresses Nigerian e-commerce challenge (customers shop at odd hours)
- Positions AI as employee, not robot (builds trust)
- Emphasizes "FREE included" (not extra cost)
