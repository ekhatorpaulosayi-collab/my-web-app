## SUMMARY (Plain Language)

**For Store Owners:**
- You run your own business - we just provide the software
- You handle all customer transactions, payments, and issues
- We're not involved in your sales - you're fully responsible
- Configure your own payment accounts (Paystack, OPay, etc.)
- We can't help with refunds, disputes, or delivery issues

**For Customers:**
- You're buying from the store owner, not from Storehouse
- Storehouse is just the website platform (like Shopify)
- For order issues, contact the store owner directly
- Refunds and returns are the store owner's responsibility
- Storehouse doesn't hold your money or process payments

**Key Point:** Storehouse = Software Platform. We don't touch money, products, or customer service. Everything happens between you and the store owner.

**By using Storehouse, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Service.**
