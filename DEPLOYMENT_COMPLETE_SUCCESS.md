You were one of our first 21 users. You believed in Storehouse before it was big.

As a THANK YOU, we've given you:

Why? Because you helped us build this. You gave feedback. You found bugs. You trusted us.

This is permanent. Even if we change pricing later, your unlimited access stays.

Welcome to the Founding Members Club! 🏆

With gratitude,
The Storehouse Team

P.S. Check your AI chat widget - you'll see your special status! 🎊
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)

### **1. Test Everything**

Run the recommended tests above to verify:
- Beta users have unlimited
- New users have 30/month limit
- Storefront has 7/day limit

### **2. Send Thank You Email**

Email your 21 beta users to:
- Make them feel special
- Build brand loyalty
- Create word-of-mouth marketing

### **3. Monitor Usage**

Check logs periodically:
```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_0e49aecc340f38054a0a937101177d76f7b3574c \
supabase functions logs ai-chat
```

Watch for:
- Quota check errors
- Users hitting limits
- Heavy usage patterns

### **4. Update Landing Page (Optional)**

Current text:
```tsx
"Unlimited AI chats (beta testing)"
```

Consider changing to:
```tsx
"30 AI assistant chats/month - perfect for getting started!"
```

But this is optional - current text is fine during beta.

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### **1. Beta Users Are Permanent**

```
✅ DO NOT change grandfathered = false
✅ DO NOT reduce their limits
✅ DO NOT ask them to pay for AI

This is PERMANENT. It builds:
- Loyalty
- Word-of-mouth marketing
- Brand advocates
```

### **2. Storefront Limits Are Separate**

```
The 7/day storefront limit applies to EVERYONE:
- Beta users ✅
- Free users ✅
- Paid users ✅

This is correct! It prevents:
- Customer abuse
- Bot spam
- Excessive API costs
```

### **3. Quota Resets Monthly**

```
Free tier (30 chats):
- Resets: 1st day of each month
- Example: Used 30 in January
- February 1st: Back to 30/30 available

Storefront (7/day):
- Resets: Every 24 hours
- Example: Used 7 on Monday 3pm
- Tuesday 3pm: Back to 7/7 available
```
