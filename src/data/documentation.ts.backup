Variants let you track one product with multiple options:
- Sizes: S, M, L, XL
- Colors: Red, Blue, Green
- Packages: 500ml, 1L, 2L

**When to Use Variants:**
- Fashion items (sizes/colors)
- Beverages (different volumes)
- Bulk items (different pack sizes)

**How to Add Variants:**
1. When adding/editing a product, scroll to "Product Variants" section
2. Click "+ Add Variant"
3. Enter variant name (e.g., "Small - Red")
4. Set quantity and price for each variant
5. Save product

**Key Points:**
- Each variant tracks its own stock quantity
- Total stock = sum of all variant quantities
- You can set different prices per variant
- Variants show as sub-items in product list

**Example:**
Product: "Men's T-Shirt"
- Variant 1: Small (20 units, ₦2,000)
- Variant 2: Medium (30 units, ₦2,000)
- Variant 3: Large (15 units, ₦2,500)
Total Stock: 65 units`,

    description: 'Learn the difference between Add and Replace stock modes to manage inventory accurately.',
    content: `**Stock Update Modes Explained:**

When editing a product, you'll see two stock modes:

**1. ADD MODE (Increase Stock)**
- Use when: Receiving new stock/restocking
- Example: You have 10 units, receive 20 more
- Action: Enter "20" in quantity field
- Result: Total stock becomes 30 (10 + 20)
- Best for: Regular restocking, purchase orders

**2. REPLACE MODE (Set Exact Stock)**
- Use when: Stock taking/physical count
- Example: After counting, you have exactly 25 units
- Action: Enter "25" in quantity field
- Result: Total stock becomes 25 (replaces old value)
- Best for: Inventory audits, fixing errors

**Which Mode to Choose?**
- Restocking from supplier? → ADD
- Physical stock count? → REPLACE
- Fixing wrong quantity? → REPLACE
- Regular business operation? → ADD

**Pro Tip:**
Storehouse automatically uses weighted average cost when you add stock at different purchase prices. This gives you accurate profit calculations!`,

    description: 'Set up low stock alerts and quickly reorder items before they run out.',
    content: `**Low Stock Alerts:**

Storehouse automatically flags products when stock is low (default: below 10 units).

**How to View Low Stock:**
1. Click "Low Stock" button on dashboard
2. See all products needing reorder
3. Red ⚠️ icon shows on product list

**Setting Custom Thresholds:**
1. Edit product → Scroll to "Reorder Level"
2. Set your preferred minimum stock (e.g., 5 units)
3. Product will alert when stock drops below this number

**Quick Restocking:**
From Low Stock page:
1. Enter quantity to add for each item
2. Updates multiple products at once
3. Fast and efficient!

**Best Practices:**
- Set higher thresholds for fast-moving items
- Check low stock daily before placing supplier orders
- Use low stock report to forecast purchases
- Popular items should have reorder level = 2 weeks of sales

**Pro Tip:**
Your daily EOD report shows low stock count to help you plan orders!`,

**Sample CSV Format:**
\`\`\`csv
name,cost_price,selling_price,quantity,category

Peak Milk,120,150,200,Beverages
Men's Shirt,800,1500,30,Fashion
\`\`\`

**Troubleshooting:**
- Invalid price errors → Ensure no currency symbols (₦)
- Quantity errors → Must be whole numbers only
- Category not recognized → Use existing categories or "General Merchandise"`,

    content: `**Payment Methods Explained:**

**CASH SALES 💵**
- Customer pays immediately
- Money is in your hand/account now
- Immediate revenue recognition
- No debt to track

When to use:
- Walk-in customers paying on the spot
- Mobile money transfers received
- Bank transfers confirmed
- Cash-on-delivery paid

**CREDIT SALES 📝**
- Customer buys now, pays later
- Creates a debt record automatically
- Customer owes you money
- Track who owes what

When to use:
- Trusted customers (regulars)
- Business accounts with payment terms
- "I'll pay you tomorrow" situations
- Post-dated cheques

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Cash | Credit |
|--------|------|--------|
| Payment | Now | Later |
| Revenue | Immediate | Pending |
| Risk | None | Customer may not pay |
| Tracking | Simple | Requires follow-up |

**Best Practices:**
- Only give credit to trusted customers
- Set credit limits per customer
- Follow up on outstanding debts weekly
- Use credit for customer relationship building

    content: `**What is Staff Mode?**

Staff Mode is activated when:
1. You (the Owner) log in as a staff member using their PIN
2. A staff member uses their PIN to access Storehouse
3. You want to test staff permissions

**How to Enter Staff Mode:**
1. Dashboard → Click staff icon or "Staff Login"
2. Enter staff member's 4-digit PIN
3. You're now using Storehouse as that staff member
4. Features are limited based on their role

**How to Exit Staff Mode (Return to Owner):**
Method 1: Settings → Exit Staff Mode
Method 2: Refresh page (staff sessions don't persist)
Method 3: Log out and log back in with owner password

**Common Confusion:**

**"Why can't I edit products?"**
→ You're in Staff mode. Exit to Owner mode.

**"Edit button is missing!"**
→ Staff mode restrictions. Switch to Owner mode.

**"Settings option disappeared!"**
→ Staff don't have Settings access. Exit Staff mode.

**Visual Indicators:**
- Owner mode: All buttons visible
- Staff mode: Limited buttons, role shown in header

**Best Practice:**
- Use Owner mode for management tasks
- Use Staff mode only to test permissions or when staff is working
- Staff sessions auto-clear on page reload (for security)`,

    priority: 90,
    description: 'Solve the common issue of missing edit and delete buttons on products.',
    content: `**Problem:**
Edit (pencil) and Delete (trash) buttons are not showing next to products.

**Most Common Cause: Staff Mode**

You are logged in as a Staff member with restricted permissions, not as the Owner.

**Solution:**

**If you are the Owner:**
1. Go to Settings (if you can see it)
2. Look for "Exit Staff Mode" or "Staff Management"
3. Click "Exit Staff Mode"
4. Refresh the page
5. Buttons should now appear

**If Settings is hidden:**
1. Log out completely
2. Log back in with your OWNER email and password (not staff PIN)
3. Buttons will appear

**Other Possible Causes:**

**1. Browser Cache Issue**
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- This hard refreshes and clears cached old code
- Buttons should appear after refresh

**2. Slow Internet/Loading**
- Wait a few seconds for page to fully load
- Check if internet connection is stable

**3. Account Type**
- Free plan users have all editing rights
- This is not a plan limitation

**How to Confirm You're in Owner Mode:**
- Settings menu is visible
- "Staff Management" option exists
- All dashboard features accessible
- No role badge showing (Manager/Cashier)

**Prevention:**
- Don't save staff sessions in browser
- Always log in as Owner for management tasks
- Use staff mode only when testing or when staff is working

**Still Not Working?**
Contact support with:
- Screenshot of your dashboard
- Your account email
- Browser name and version`,

    description: 'Resolve issues with data not syncing across devices or after going offline.',
    content: `**Problem:**
Changes not appearing, products missing, or sales not syncing.

**Understanding Sync:**
Storehouse works offline and syncs when online:
- Changes saved locally first (immediate)
- Syncs to cloud when internet available
- Updates across all devices

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

**1. Check Internet Connection**
- Open another website to confirm internet works
- Check if you're on WiFi or mobile data
- Slow connection can delay sync

**2. Force Refresh**
- Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clears cache and reloads fresh data

**3. Check Sync Status**
- Look for sync indicator on dashboard
- "Syncing..." or "Synced" status
- Red warning if sync failed

**4. Re-login**
- Log out completely
- Log back in
- Forces fresh data download

**5. Clear Browser Data**
- Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Do NOT clear cookies (you'll be logged out)

**Common Scenarios:**

**"Added product offline, not showing when online"**
→ Wait 30 seconds, refresh page. Product should appear.

**"Two devices showing different data"**
→ Refresh both devices. Last change wins.

**"Deleted product still showing"**
→ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R). If persists, re-login.

**Prevention:**
- Ensure stable internet for critical operations
- Refresh page daily
- Don't use multiple devices simultaneously
- Wait for sync completion before closing browser

**Advanced: Check Browser Console**
1. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for sync errors
