    content: `**How Stock Tracking Works:**

When you:
- **Add a product**: Set initial stock quantity
- **Record a sale**: Stock automatically decreases
- **Restock**: Edit product to increase quantity

**Example:**

1. You have 50 units of Rice
2. Customer buys 5 units
3. Stock automatically becomes 45 units
4. No manual calculation needed!

**Low Stock Alerts:**

Set a low stock threshold for each product:
- Product: Rice
- Quantity: 45 units
- Low Stock Threshold: 10 units

When stock reaches 10 or below:
⚠️ Alert appears on dashboard
📧 Optional email notification

**How to Restock Products:**

1. Edit the product
2. Update quantity field to new stock level
3. Save

**Alternative:** Some businesses track restocking as "negative sales" or use a stock adjustment log.

**Stock Movements:**

Storehouse logs every stock change:
- Initial stock
- Sales (decrease)
- Restocks (increase)
- Manual adjustments

**Inventory Reports:**

View:
- Total inventory value (cost × quantity)
- Low stock items
- Out of stock items
- Best-selling items (by quantity)

**Best Practices:**

✅ Set realistic low stock thresholds
✅ Restock before running out
✅ Regular inventory audits (weekly/monthly)
✅ Track cost price accurately for profit calculations`,

    description: 'Set up and manage low stock alerts to prevent stockouts.',
    content: `**What are Low Stock Alerts?**

Automatic warnings when products are running low, so you can restock before running out completely.

**How to Set Up:**

1. Edit a product
2. Find "Low Stock Threshold" field
3. Enter minimum quantity (e.g., 10)
4. Save product

**Example:**

Product: Indomie Noodles
Current Stock: 50 cartons
Low Stock Threshold: 10 cartons

When stock reaches 10 or below:
⚠️ **Yellow badge** appears next to product
🔔 **Dashboard alert** shows warning
📧 **Email notification** (if enabled)

**Where to View Alerts:**

- **Dashboard**: Red/yellow badges on products
- **Low Stock Tab**: Dedicated view of all low stock items
- **Reports**: Low stock report

**Best Threshold Values:**

Depends on how fast you sell:

Fast-moving items (sell daily):
- Threshold: 20-30 units

Medium-moving items (sell weekly):
- Threshold: 10-15 units

Slow-moving items (sell monthly):
- Threshold: 5 units

**Action When Alert Appears:**

1. Check how many days of stock remain
2. Calculate reorder quantity
3. Contact supplier
4. Update stock when new inventory arrives

**Turn Off Alerts:**

Set threshold to 0 to disable alerts for a product`,

    description: 'Learn when to use cash sales vs credit sales and how to track customer debts.',
    content: `**What's the Difference?**

**Cash Sale:**
- Customer pays IMMEDIATELY (cash, transfer, POS, etc.)
- Money is in your hand or bank account NOW
- No debt tracking needed
- Example: Customer buys rice for ₦30,000 and pays cash

**Credit Sale:**
- Customer takes goods NOW, pays LATER
- You record the sale + customer debt
- Track when payment is due
- Example: Customer buys rice for ₦30,000, promises to pay on Friday

**When to Use Cash:**
- Walk-in customers
- Unknown customers
- Small purchases
- Customers with debt history

**When to Use Credit:**
- Trusted regular customers
- B2B transactions
- Large orders
- Established relationships

**How to Record Credit Sale:**

1. Record sale normally
2. Toggle "Credit Sale" switch
3. Enter customer name (required for credit)
4. Set due date (when customer promises to pay)
5. Save - debt is automatically tracked!

**Tracking Credit:**

View all customer debts in:
- Dashboard → Customer Debts
- Customers → Select customer → View debt

**Get Paid:**

When customer pays:
1. Find their debt record
2. Tap "Record Payment"
3. Enter amount paid
4. Payment method
5. Save!

**Best Practices:**

✅ Only give credit to trusted customers
✅ Set realistic due dates
✅ Send reminders before due date
✅ Track partial payments
✅ Limit credit per customer

**Nigerian Context:**

Many businesses give credit to:
- Mama Nkechi (regular customer for 5 years)
- Brother Emeka (church member)
- Sister Blessing (pays every month-end)

But NOT to:
- New customers
- One-time buyers
- Customers who owe already`,

**How to Record Channel:**

When recording a sale:
1. Select product
2. Choose sales channel dropdown
3. Pick where customer bought from

**Before tracking channels:**
- Mixed up where sales came from
- Wasted time on slow channels

    content: `**What is PIN Login?**

Instead of sharing your password with employees, Storehouse uses **4-digit PINs**.

**Benefits:**
✅ Staff can't access your personal account
✅ Easy to remember (4 digits)
✅ Easy to change if needed
✅ Track who did what

**How Staff Logs In:**

**Step 1: Open Storehouse**
- Staff goes to storehouse.ng
- Or opens the app

**Step 2: Enter Phone Number**
- They enter their registered phone
- Example: 0901 234 5678

**Step 3: Select "Staff Login"**
- NOT owner login!
- Click **Login as Staff**

**Step 4: Enter 4-Digit PIN**
- Type the PIN you gave them
- Example: 1234
- Click **Login**

**Step 5: They're In!**
- Access based on their role
- Can only do what you allowed

**Example Login Screen:**

\`\`\`
STAFF LOGIN
-----------
Phone: 0901 234 5678

Enter Your PIN:
[_] [_] [_] [_]

Forgot PIN? Contact your manager.
\`\`\`

**Creating Good PINs:**

✅ **Good PINs:**
- 2468 (easy pattern)
- 1379 (odd numbers)
- 2580 (phone keypad middle)

❌ **Avoid:**
- 1234 (too obvious)
- 0000 (very weak)
- 1111 (too simple)
- Staff's birthday (easy to guess)

**Changing PINs:**

**As Owner:**
1. Go to **Staff** page
2. Click staff member
3. Click **Reset PIN**
4. Enter new 4-digit PIN
5. Share with staff

**As Staff Member:**
- Staff CANNOT change their own PIN
- They must ask you (the owner)

**Security Features:**

**5 Wrong Attempts = Locked**
- If someone enters wrong PIN 5 times
- Account locks for 30 minutes
- Prevents unauthorized access

**Auto-Logout:**
- Staff auto-logged out after 8 hours
- Or when they close the app
- Must re-enter PIN next time

**Activity Tracking:**
- You see when staff logs in
- When they log out
- What they do while logged in

**Example Activity Log:**

\`\`\`

**Common PIN Issues:**

**Problem 1: Staff Forgot PIN**
- You reset it for them
- Give new PIN
- They log in again

**Problem 2: Wrong PIN 5 Times (Locked)**
- Wait 30 minutes
- OR you can unlock them:
  - Go to Staff page
  - Click staff member
  - Click **Unlock Account**

**Problem 3: PIN Not Working**
- Verify they're using correct phone number
- Check if account is active
- Try resetting PIN

**Problem 4: Staff Sharing PINs**
- Educate staff: "Don't share PINs!"
- Change PINs regularly
- Monitor for suspicious activity

**PIN vs Password:**

**Owner Password:**
- Full access to everything
- Change subscription
- Delete business
- Add/remove staff
- View all financial data

**Staff PIN:**
- Limited access
- Only what you allowed
- Can't change settings
- Can't view sensitive data

**Best Practices:**

✅ Change PINs every 3 months
✅ Use unique PINs for each staff
✅ Don't write PINs down publicly
✅ Monitor login activity
✅ Deactivate former staff immediately

❌ Don't use same PIN for everyone
❌ Don't share your owner password
❌ Don't ignore failed login attempts`,

    content: `**What is SEO?**

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) = Making your store easy to find on Google.

**Why It Matters:**

When someone searches Google for:
- "Buy Indomie in Lagos"
- "Golden Penny Flour online"
- "Food store in Ikeja"

Your store could appear in results!

**Basic SEO Setup:**

**Step 1: Add Store Description**
- Go to **Online Store Settings**
- Write clear description (150-200 words)

Good example:
\`\`\`
"Mama Ngozi Store is your trusted online supermarket in Lagos, Nigeria. We sell quality food items, beverages, household products, and cooking essentials at affordable prices. Order online and get fast delivery across Lagos and Nigeria. Shop Golden Penny Flour, Dangote Sugar, Indomie Noodles, and more. Same-day delivery available!"
\`\`\`

Why it works:
- Mentions location (Lagos, Nigeria)
- Lists popular products (Golden Penny, Dangote)
- Includes key terms (online supermarket, delivery)

**Step 2: Optimize Product Names**

❌ **Bad:** "Flour 50kg"
✅ **Good:** "Golden Penny Flour 50kg - Premium Wheat Flour"

❌ **Bad:** "Sugar"
✅ **Good:** "Dangote Sugar 1kg - White Refined Sugar"

Include:
- Brand name
- Product type
- Size/quantity
- Key features

**Step 3: Write Product Descriptions**

Don't leave blank! Google reads descriptions.

❌ **Bad:** "Flour for cooking"

✅ **Good:**
\`\`\`
"Golden Penny Flour 50kg is Nigeria's #1 choice for baking, puff-puff, and pastries. Made from premium wheat, this flour gives soft, fluffy results. Perfect for bakeries, restaurants, and home use. Order online with fast delivery across Lagos and Nigeria."
\`\`\`

Include:
- What it's used for
- Benefits
- Who it's for
- Call to action ("Order online")

**Step 4: Add Product Images**

Google favors stores with images.

✅ Upload clear product photos
✅ Multiple angles if possible
✅ Well-lit, high quality
✅ Image file name: "golden-penny-flour-50kg.jpg" (NOT "IMG_1234.jpg")

**Step 5: Use Categories**

Organize products:
- **Grains & Cereals** (Rice, Flour, Oats)
- **Beverages** (Milo, Coca-Cola, Peak Milk)
- **Cooking Essentials** (Oil, Salt, Sugar)
- **Snacks** (Indomie, Biscuits, Gala)

Google shows category pages in search results!

**Step 6: Add Location Keywords**

If you deliver to specific areas, mention them:
- "Delivery to Ikeja, Lekki, Victoria Island"
- "Serving Lagos Mainland and Island"
- "Available in Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt"

**Advanced SEO:**

**Blog Posts (Pro Feature):**

Write helpful articles:
- "10 Uses for Golden Penny Flour"
- "How to Make Perfect Jollof Rice"
- "Best Cooking Oil for Nigerian Dishes"

Include your products in articles + links to buy.

**Customer Reviews:**

Encourage customers to leave reviews:
- "How was your order? Leave a review!"
- Reviews boost Google ranking
- 5-star ratings attract more customers

**Social Media Integration:**

Link your store to:
- Facebook Business Page
- Instagram Profile
- Twitter

Google sees social signals as trust factor.

**Google My Business:**

Create free Google Business Profile:
1. Go to google.com/business
2. Add your business
3. Add store URL
4. Get verified
5. Appear on Google Maps!

When someone searches "supermarket near me" → Your store shows!

**Monitor Store Traffic:**

Storehouse tracks:
- **Visitors:** How many people visit
- **Where from:** Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, Direct
- **Popular searches:** What customers search on your store
- **Top products viewed**

Example:
\`\`\`
TRAFFIC SOURCES (This Month)
----------------------------
Google Search: 347 visits (28%)
Facebook: 512 visits (41%)
WhatsApp: 289 visits (23%)
Direct (typed URL): 99 visits (8%)

TOP GOOGLE SEARCHES:
1. "buy indomie online lagos"
2. "golden penny flour delivery"
3. "mama ngozi store"
\`\`\`

**Improve Based on Data:**

- Lots of searches for "Indomie"?
  → Add more Indomie varieties
  → Write blog: "Indomie Recipes"

- Traffic from Facebook high?
  → Post more on Facebook
  → Run Facebook ads

**Content Ideas:**

Create pages for:
- **About Us** - Your story, why customers trust you
- **Delivery Information** - Where you deliver, how long
- **FAQs** - Common questions answered
- **Contact Us** - Phone, WhatsApp, email, address

Google ranks stores with more content higher!

**Technical SEO (Auto-Handled by Storehouse):**

✅ Mobile-friendly design
✅ Fast loading speed
✅ HTTPS security
✅ XML sitemap
✅ Structured data markup

You don't need to worry about these - Storehouse handles it!

**Local SEO:**

Target local customers:
- Mention neighborhood names (Ikeja, Surulere, Ajah)
- Add "Near [Landmark]" to product titles
  - Example: "Golden Penny Flour - Delivery Near Shoprite Ikeja"

**Track Your Google Ranking:**

Check where you appear:
- Search "your business name" → Should be #1
- Search "buy [product] in [city]" → Aim for first page

**Boost Ranking:**

✅ Get more customer reviews (ask every customer!)

    description: 'Understand why edit buttons might be hidden and how to access them.',
    content: `**Common Issue:**

"I can't find the edit button on my product/sale/customer!"

**Why This Happens:**

1. **You're logged in as Staff (not Owner)**
2. **Screen is too small (mobile view)**
3. **Item is locked for editing**
4. **Page hasn't fully loaded**
5. **Browser issue**

**Solution 1: Check Your Login Role**

If you're logged in as **Cashier** or **Staff** (not Owner):
- Cashiers can't edit products
- Only Owners and Managers can edit

**How to check:**
- Look at top right corner

**Step 3:** Click the edit icon (pencil ✏️)

**Solution 4: Open Item Details First**

**Step 1:** Click the product/sale/customer name
**Step 2:** Details page opens

**Solution 5: Refresh the Page**

Sometimes buttons don't load:

**Step 1:** Press **F5** (Windows) or **Cmd+R** (Mac)
**Step 2:** Page reloads
**Step 3:** Buttons should appear now

**Solution 6: Clear Browser Cache**

If refresh doesn't work:

    content: `**Common Sync Issues:**

1. "Sales not showing up"
2. "Product changes not saving"
3. "Data looks old/outdated"
4. "Changes made on phone not showing on computer"
5. "Offline mode stuck"

**Understanding How Sync Works:**

Storehouse saves data in the cloud:
- When you add a sale → Sent to cloud
- When you edit a product → Saved in cloud
- Other devices download latest from cloud

**If internet is slow/offline:**
- Changes saved on device first
- Uploaded when internet returns
- "Pending sync" shown

**Check Your Connection:**

**Step 1: Test Internet**
- Open another website (google.com)
- Does it load?
- If NO → Internet issue
- If YES → Storehouse issue

**Step 2: Check Storehouse Status**
- Look for **green checkmark** ✅ (top right)
- Green = Connected
- Yellow ⚠️ = Syncing
- Red 🔴 = Offline

**Step 3: Check Sync Queue**
- Click sync icon
- See pending changes
- Wait for them to upload

**Solution 1: Refresh the Page**

**On computer:**
- Press **F5** (Windows) or **Cmd+R** (Mac)
- Or click refresh button in browser

**On phone app:**
- Swipe down on screen (pull to refresh)
- Or close app and reopen

**Solution 2: Wait for Sync to Complete**

If you see "Syncing..." or ⚠️:
- Wait 30-60 seconds
- Don't close the app/browser
- Let it finish

Progress shown:
"Syncing 3 of 5 changes..." → Almost done!

**Solution 3: Check Internet Connection**

**No internet?**
- Turn on mobile data or WiFi
- Check airplane mode is OFF
- Try other apps to confirm internet works

**Slow internet?**
- Sync may take longer
- Be patient
- Don't make new changes until current sync completes

**Solution 4: Force Sync**

**Step 1:** Click sync icon (🔄) or **⚠️**
**Step 2:** Click **Sync Now**
**Step 3:** Wait for completion
**Step 4:** ✅ appears when done

**Solution 5: Log Out and Log Back In**

If sync stuck:

**Step 1:** Click your profile → **Log Out**
**Step 2:** Close browser/app completely
**Step 3:** Reopen Storehouse
**Step 4:** Log back in
**Step 5:** Data syncs fresh from cloud

**⚠️ Warning:** Only do this if connected to internet! Otherwise local changes may be lost.

**Solution 6: Clear App Cache (Mobile)**

**Android:**
1. Settings → Apps → Storehouse
2. Storage → Clear Cache (NOT Clear Data!)
3. Reopen Storehouse

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → General → iPhone Storage
2. Storehouse → Offload App
3. Reinstall from App Store

**Solution 7: Update the App**

Outdated app may have sync bugs:

**Step 1:** Go to App Store (iPhone) or Play Store (Android)
**Step 2:** Search "Storehouse"
**Step 3:** If "Update" button shows → Click it
**Step 4:** Reopen app after update

**Prevent Sync Issues:**

✅ Keep internet connected when possible
✅ Sync regularly (don't accumulate many offline changes)
✅ Update app when prompted
✅ Don't force-close app during sync
✅ Use WiFi for large data uploads

**Offline Mode:**

Storehouse works offline!
- Record sales without internet
- Add products
- View existing data

**When internet returns:**
- Changes auto-sync
- May take a few minutes
- ⚠️ icon shows during sync

**Conflict Resolution:**

If same data edited on 2 devices:

Example:
- You edit "Indomie" price to ₦150 on phone
- Manager edits same product to ₦160 on computer
- Who wins?

**Storehouse rule:** Last change wins
- If manager saved after you → ₦160
- You get notification: "Product was updated by someone else"

**To avoid:**
- Communicate with staff
- "I'm editing Indomie, don't touch it!"

**Data Safety:**

Don't worry - your data is safe:
✅ Auto-saved every 30 seconds
✅ Backed up to cloud
✅ Even if sync fails, saved on device
✅ Will retry sync automatically

**Check Sync History:**

See what was synced:
1. Settings → Sync History
2. View all synced changes
3. See timestamps
4. Verify your changes uploaded
