## WHERE TO ADD HUMAN FACE (AI-GENERATED)

### OPTION 1: Picture-in-Picture (RECOMMENDED) ✅

**Use AI face reactions in corner of screen:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Exercise Book (Main)        │
│                             │
│  [Messy notebook photo]     │
│                             │
│              ┌────────┐     │  ← Face here
│              │ 😱 Face│     │     (bottom right)
│              │ Shocked│     │     Size: 25% of screen
│              └────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────────┘

TIMING:
- 0:04-0:08: Shocked/disappointed face (exercise book scene)
- 0:08-0:12: Nodding/agreeing face (upgrade scene)
- 0:16-0:19: Pointing/excited face (CTA scene)
```

**Type of face shots:**

**Scene 1 (0:04-0:08) - "Exercise Book" Problem:**
- **Shot type:** Close-up, shoulders up
- **Expression:** Shocked, mouth slightly open, eyebrows raised
- **Action:** Looking down at exercise book then back at camera
- **Mood:** "Chai! This person still using book?"

**Scene 2 (0:08-0:12) - "Oya na upgrade" Solution:**
- **Shot type:** Medium close-up, chest up
- **Expression:** Nodding slowly, slight smile appearing
- **Action:** Slow nod of approval, hand gesturing "yes yes"
- **Mood:** "E don make sense now"

**Scene 3 (0:16-0:19) - "Comment JOSEPH" CTA:**
- **Shot type:** Close-up, shoulders up
- **Expression:** Excited, big smile, eyes wide
- **Action:** Pointing directly at camera
- **Mood:** "You, yes you! Do am now!"

---

### OPTION 2: Full-Screen Face (More Personal)

**Replace background entirely with talking face:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│     [HUMAN FACE FILLING     │
│      ENTIRE SCREEN]         │
│                             │
│   TEXT OVERLAY: "YOU FOR    │
│   2026 📓😭"                │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘

TIMING: Only on Scene 2 (0:04-0:08)
Then back to screen recordings
```

**Less recommended** - loses focus on product

---

### OPTION 3: Split Screen (Creative)

```
┌───────────────┬─────────────┐
│  Exercise     │  Your Face  │
│  Book         │  Reacting   │
│  (Left 50%)   │  (Right 50%)│
│               │             │
│  📓 Messy     │  😱 You     │
│  notebook     │  shocked    │
└───────────────┴─────────────┘

TIMING: 0:04-0:08 only
```

**Moderately recommended** - more complex to edit

---

## HOW TO GET AI-GENERATED FACE REACTIONS

### Method 1: HeyGen (BEST for faces)

**Steps:**
1. Go to HeyGen.com
2. Click "Create Video"
3. Choose avatar: Nigerian-looking person (male/female)
4. **Don't paste script** - just generate silent reaction shots:
   - Generate 3 separate 3-second clips
   - Clip 1: Shocked expression
   - Clip 2: Nodding approval
   - Clip 3: Pointing excited
5. Download green-screen version (so background is transparent)
6. Layer over your main footage in CapCut

**Cost:** Free tier = 1 min/month (enough for 3 clips)

---

### Method 2: D-ID (Alternative)

**Steps:**
1. Go to D-ID.com
2. Upload a stock photo of Nigerian person (Pexels/Unsplash)
3. Generate 3 different emotion clips:
   - "Look shocked and disappointed"
   - "Nod slowly with approval"
   - "Point at camera excitedly"
4. Download clips
5. Use in CapCut as picture-in-picture

**Cost:** 20 free credits (5 min video)

---

### Method 3: Stock Footage (FREE, No AI)

**Steps:**
1. Go to Pexels Videos or Pixabay
2. Search: "Nigerian person shocked"
3. Search: "African person nodding"
4. Search: "Black person pointing camera"
5. Download free clips
6. Use in your video

**Downside:** Won't be perfectly synced to your script

---

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH (Best Results)

**Mix real + AI for authenticity:**

**0:00-0:04:** No face (Joseph/Egypt image only)
**0:04-0:08:** AI face (shocked) - picture-in-picture, bottom-right, 25% size
**0:08-0:12:** AI face (nodding) - same position
**0:12-0:16:** No face (screen recording only)
**0:16-0:19:** AI face (pointing) - full screen for 3 seconds
**0:19-0:22:** No face (logo/CTA only)

**Why this works:**
- 3 face appearances = human connection
- Not overdone = doesn't distract from product
- Strategic placement = emphasizes key moments

---

## EXACT AI PROMPT FOR HEYGEN

**When generating avatar clips:**

**Clip 1 (Shocked - 4 seconds):**
```
Expression: Shocked and disappointed
Action: Look down, shake head slowly, look back at camera with disbelief
Emotion: "I can't believe you still doing this"
```

**Clip 2 (Nodding - 4 seconds):**
```
Expression: Understanding and approval
Action: Slow nod, slight smile forming, hand gesture "yes"
Emotion: "Now you're getting it"
```

**Clip 3 (Pointing - 3 seconds):**
```
Expression: Excited and urgent
Action: Point directly at camera, big smile, eyebrows raised
Emotion: "You! Do this now!"
```

## HOW TO ADD IN CAPCUT

**Picture-in-Picture Method:**

1. Import main footage (exercise book, phone screen, etc.)
2. Import AI face clips
3. Drag AI face clip ABOVE main footage in timeline
4. Resize AI face to 25% size (use pinch gesture)
5. Drag to bottom-right corner
6. Add circular mask (optional - makes it look like FaceTime)
7. Add thin white border (optional - makes it pop)

**Visual:**
```
Timeline Layers:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 3: Text overlays      │
│ Layer 2: AI Face (PiP)      │  ← 25% size, bottom-right
│ Layer 1: Main footage       │
│ Layer 0: Music + Voice      │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```
