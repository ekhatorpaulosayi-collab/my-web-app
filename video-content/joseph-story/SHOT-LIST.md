## FILMING TIPS

1. **Lighting:** Film near a window during daytime. Natural light is best.

3. **Stability:** Rest phone on a book/box if you don't have a tripod

4. **Screen Recording:**
   - Clean up notifications before recording
   - Use "Do Not Disturb" mode
   - Record in portrait mode (9:16 for Instagram/TikTok)
   - Go SLOW - viewers need to read text

5. **Joseph Scenes:**
   - Real emotion > perfect acting
   - Use actual store if possible (builds authenticity)
   - Friends/family can help act

6. **Multiple Takes:**
   - Film each shot 2-3 times
   - You can choose the best one during editing

## WHAT IF YOU CAN'T FILM JOSEPH SCENES?

**Alternative:** Use stock footage from:
- Pexels.com (free)
- Pixabay.com (free)
- Search: "African shop owner", "small business Nigeria", "provision store"

**BUT:** Real footage (even amateur) is MORE AUTHENTIC than stock footage for this story

**Remember:** Done is better than perfect. Start filming!
