## 📈 How to Iterate

**After posting, check analytics:**
- Where do people drop off? (cut that part shorter)
- Which text overlays get screenshot? (make more like that)
- Which scenes get replayed? (extend those)

**Make adjustments and repost in 2-3 days**

---

## 🚀 Advanced Tips

1. **Use trending audio** - Check TikTok trending sounds, match your pacing to the beat
2. **Test thumbnails** - First frame should hook (use "₦50K lost" text)
3. **Add subtitles** - 85% watch without sound, captions are critical
4. **End screen** - Last 2 seconds should be clear CTA
5. **Repost strategically** - Post to Instagram first, then TikTok 3 hours later

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to hire an actor for Joseph?**
A: No! Use yourself, a friend, or even stock footage. Authenticity > perfection.

**Q: What if I can't record voiceover?**
A: Use CapCut's text-to-speech OR just rely on text overlays (many viral videos have no voiceover).

**Q: Can I skip the Joseph scenes and just show the app?**
A: You can, but the emotional story makes it 3x more shareable. People connect with people.

**Q: What music should I use?**
A: Use CapCut's free library or check YouTube Audio Library. Filter by "upbeat" and 120-140 BPM.

**Q: Should I add effects and transitions?**
A: Keep it simple. Flash transitions, one zoom effect on the low stock badge. That's it.
