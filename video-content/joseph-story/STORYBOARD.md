## TROUBLESHOOTING

**If video feels too long:** Cut Scene 2 from 15 seconds to 10 seconds

**If video feels rushed:** Add 5 seconds to Scene 7 (hold on results longer)

**If text is unreadable:** Increase font size, add thicker outline

**If music is too loud:** Voiceover should be 80% volume, music 20-30%
